        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>For more than 15 years, I’ve worked across corporates, startups and scaleups - always focused on turning data, insights and innovation into real business.</p>
        <p>At NIQ, I advised global food and beverage brands on innovation and category strategy, helping them use data to make confident growth decisions. At Toms, I was part of bringing new products to market - experience I now use when I support ventures on their journey from idea to impact.</p>
        <p>As Program Lead in the accelerator, I guided 100+ FoodTech startups through tailored programs on product-market-fit, go-to-market, investor readiness and scale-up. I know what it takes to balance ambition, data and execution in fast-moving environments.</p>
        <p>One of my key strengths is navigating ecosystems and matchmaking across stakeholders - connecting corporates, founders, investors and partners to create shared solutions and scalable impact.</p>

            "Line has brought both heart and mind as a mentor. She ensured that we met all deadlines, worked extremely efficiently, and with her vibrant energy, she has been able to support startups in food, beverages, materials, and bioeconomy. Line asks the right questions about the core business that help sharpen focus and make the right decisions, while uncovering blind spots that are invaluable to startups. Her vast network and deep understanding of what creates value not only for startups but also for the ecosystem they operate in are key strengths. You're lucky if you get Line on board. I plan to continue working with Line, and I wholeheartedly recommend her to others - even though you'd want to keep her all to yourself."

            One of Line’s standout qualities is her ability to maintain a clear focus on Nordic Koji’s developed strategy implementation. With an impressive recollection of our initial discussions, she consistently ensured that we remained on track and aligned with our long-term plans. Her comprehensive understanding of our business goals and the industry landscape has proven invaluable in keeping our compass pointed in the right direction. Working with Line during the accelerator program has been an absolute pleasure and a true honor. Her dedication, expertise, and unwavering commitment to helping startups succeed make her an outstanding mentor and advisor. Therefore, I highly recommend Line Haugaard to any individual or organization seeking to excel and expand their startup venture.

            It is truly my pleasure to recommend Line. Throughout her time at Eat Grim, she’s provided very tangible and customer-focused, data-driven insights - and always in a very efficient manner, we never have to wait for results for long. Line has a very proactive approach and brings in new ideas and perspectives in a constructive matter, which are both key aspects in a busy startup like ours. Our whole team has learned a lot from her and are extremely thankful for the ways she has helped our company grow. I can highly recommend her as an advisor and as a positive, energetic team member that will make things happen.
